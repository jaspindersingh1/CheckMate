# GroupProject1

Itâ€™s the year 2018, and Lil Pump is currently being considered for a Grammy. Chance the Rapper was able to earn 3 grammies only two years ago without a label or an Album. Safe to say anything feels possible with some effort and having the right team.

No longer does the starving artist have to wait for an all too benevolent label or company to offer them a deal that in-turn exploits them for years.

We live in a world where independence and control is given to the artist in order to level the playing field. The day of artists, musicians, and dancers negotiating fair contracts for their skill is today and it inspires us to live the American dream!

However, most artists do not have access to their own data, or do not understand how to leverage such data for monetization.
It discourages many from taking control of their financial situations and falling victim to yet more manipulation.

Our Project is about helping artists create leverage for themselves.
Putting power back in the hands of People not corporations
